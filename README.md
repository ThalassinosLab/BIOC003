# Practical for BIOC003


In this practical we will use Python to revisit some of the concepts we covered in the tandem mass spectrometry lecture.

We will use Python to calculate the sequence and *m/z* of *a,b,y* fragment ions for a given peptide sequence.

The Python concepts covered will include:
- dictionaries (used to store the residue masses)
- for loops
